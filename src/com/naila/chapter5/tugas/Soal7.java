/* (Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition will
be $10,500. Write a program that displays the tuition in 10 years, and the total
cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition starting after the tenth year.
